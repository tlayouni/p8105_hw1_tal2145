# Problem 1

### First step is to load the tidyverse package

``` r
library(tidyverse) 
```

    ## ── Attaching packages ──────────────────── tidyverse 1.2.1 ──

    ## ✔ ggplot2 3.2.1     ✔ purrr   0.3.2
    ## ✔ tibble  2.1.3     ✔ dplyr   0.8.3
    ## ✔ tidyr   0.8.3     ✔ stringr 1.4.0
    ## ✔ readr   1.3.1     ✔ forcats 0.4.0

    ## ── Conflicts ─────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──
    ## ✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()
    ## ✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()

## Question 1, part 1: Creating a new data frame with a random sample of 8 from a normal distribution, a logical vector, character vector, and a factor vector.

``` r
Question_1_df = tibble(
  random_sample = rnorm(8),
  random_sample_gt0 = random_sample > 0, 
  vec_char = c("absolute", "abstract", "academic", "accepted", "accident", "accuracy", "accurate", "achieved"),
  vec_factor = factor(c("lowlevel", "lowlevel", "midlevel", "lowlevel", "midlevel", "biglevel","lowlevel", "biglevel"))
  )  
```

## Question 1, part 2: Taking the mean of all 4 variables from the data frame.

``` r
mean(pull(Question_1_df, random_sample))
```

    ## [1] 0.3155837

``` r
mean(pull(Question_1_df, random_sample_gt0))
```

    ## [1] 0.625

``` r
mean(pull(Question_1_df, vec_char))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(Question_1_df, vec_char)): argument is not
    ## numeric or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(pull(Question_1_df, vec_factor))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(Question_1_df, vec_factor)): argument is not
    ## numeric or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

### When taking the mean of each of the variable in the data frame “Question\_1\_df” we see that only our numeric vector produced by the random sample and our logical vector produce means, while both the character and factor vectors produce an NA response.

## Question 1, part 3: Converting the logical, character, and factor variables with “as.numeric”.

``` r
as.numeric(pull(Question_1_df, random_sample_gt0))
as.numeric(pull(Question_1_df, vec_char))
as.numeric(pull(Question_1_df, vec_factor))
```

### When we convert the logical variable to a numeric variable, we see that the “True” and “False” answers are converted into 1 and 0 answers. The factor variable is also converted to numeric, assigning a number 1, 2, or 3 to each level of the factor. But when the same function “as.numeric” is applied to the character variable, R is unable to convert this variable type into any numbers, as there is no way for R to compare character values or rank them in order to produce and number value. This explains how in the earlier steps, we were able to get a mean value for the logical variable but why we were unable to output a mean for the character variable.

## Question 1, part 4: Converting variables and multiplying them by another.

``` r
product_numeric = as.numeric(pull(Question_1_df, random_sample_gt0))*(pull(Question_1_df, random_sample))
product_factor = as.factor(pull(Question_1_df, random_sample_gt0))*(pull(Question_1_df, random_sample))
```

    ## Warning in Ops.factor(as.factor(pull(Question_1_df, random_sample_gt0)), :
    ## '*' not meaningful for factors

``` r
logical_to_factor = as.factor(pull(Question_1_df, random_sample_gt0))
product_factor_numeric= as.numeric(logical_to_factor)*(pull(Question_1_df, random_sample))
```
