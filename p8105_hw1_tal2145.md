## Question 1

**First step is to load the tidyverse
    package**

``` r
library(tidyverse) 
```

    ## ── Attaching packages ───────────────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse 1.2.1 ──

    ## ✔ ggplot2 3.2.1     ✔ purrr   0.3.2
    ## ✔ tibble  2.1.3     ✔ dplyr   0.8.3
    ## ✔ tidyr   0.8.3     ✔ stringr 1.4.0
    ## ✔ readr   1.3.1     ✔ forcats 0.4.0

    ## ── Conflicts ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──
    ## ✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()
    ## ✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()

**Question 1, part 1: Creating a new data frame with a random sample of
8 from a normal distribution, a logical vector, character vector, and a
factor vector.**

``` r
Question_1_df = tibble(
  random_sample = rnorm(8),
  random_sample_gt0 = random_sample > 0, 
  vec_char = c("absolute", "abstract", "academic", "accepted", "accident", "accuracy", "accurate", "achieved"),
  vec_factor = factor(c("lowlevel", "lowlevel", "midlevel", "lowlevel", "midlevel", "biglevel","lowlevel", "biglevel"))
  )  
```

**Question 1, part 2: Taking the mean of all 4 variables from the data
frame.**

``` r
mean(pull(Question_1_df, random_sample))
```

    ## [1] 0.09521456

``` r
mean(pull(Question_1_df, random_sample_gt0))
```

    ## [1] 0.625

``` r
mean(pull(Question_1_df, vec_char))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(Question_1_df, vec_char)): argument is not
    ## numeric or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(pull(Question_1_df, vec_factor))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(Question_1_df, vec_factor)): argument is not
    ## numeric or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

When taking the mean of each of the variable in the data frame
“Question\_1\_df” we see that only our numeric vector produced by the
random sample and our logical vector produce means, while both the
character and factor vectors produce an NA response.

**Question 1, part 3: Converting the logical, character, and factor
variables with “as.numeric”.**

``` r
as.numeric(pull(Question_1_df, random_sample_gt0))

as.numeric(pull(Question_1_df, vec_char))

as.numeric(pull(Question_1_df, vec_factor))
```

When we convert the logical variable to a numeric variable, we see that
the “True” and “False” answers are converted into 1 and 0 answers. The
factor variable is also converted to numeric, assigning a number 1, 2,
or 3 to each level of the factor. But when the same function
“as.numeric” is applied to the character variable, R is unable to
convert this variable type into any numbers, as there is no way for R to
compare character values or rank them in order to produce and number
value. This explains how in the earlier steps, we were able to get a
mean value for the logical variable but why we were unable to output a
mean for the character variable.

**Question 1, part 4: Converting variables and multiplying them by
another.**

``` r
product_numeric = as.numeric(pull(Question_1_df, random_sample_gt0))*(pull(Question_1_df, random_sample))

product_factor = as.factor(pull(Question_1_df, random_sample_gt0))*(pull(Question_1_df, random_sample))
```

    ## Warning in Ops.factor(as.factor(pull(Question_1_df, random_sample_gt0)), :
    ## '*' not meaningful for factors

``` r
logical_to_factor = as.numeric(as.factor(pull(Question_1_df, random_sample_gt0)))*(pull(Question_1_df, random_sample))
```

# Question 2

**Question 2, part 1: Creating a data frame with an x and y variable, a
logical vector and a factor vector**

``` r
Question_2_df = tibble(
x = rnorm(500),
y = rnorm(500),
sum_gt1 = x + y > 1,
sum_gt1_numeric = as.numeric(sum_gt1),
sum_gt1_factor = as.factor(sum_gt1),
)
```

**“Question\_2\_df” is a data frame containing:**

  - 5 columns
  - 500 rows
  - The variable x has a mean of 0.0176933
  - The variable x has a median of -0.0327926
  - The variable x has a standard deviation of 1.0026716

\*\*Question 2, part 2: Creating a scatterplot of x vs. y using
ggplot

``` r
ggplot(Question_2_df, aes(x = x, y = y, color = sum_gt1)) + geom_point()
```

![](p8105_hw1_tal2145_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png)<!-- -->

``` r
ggplot(Question_2_df, aes(x = x, y = y, color = sum_gt1_numeric)) + geom_point()
```

![](p8105_hw1_tal2145_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-5-2.png)<!-- -->

``` r
ggplot(Question_2_df, aes(x = x, y = y, color = sum_gt1_factor)) + geom_point()
```

![](p8105_hw1_tal2145_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-5-3.png)<!-- -->

The color scale on both the scatterplots colored for the logical and
factor variables use a two tone color scale to represent False (red) and
True (blue) because there are only two possible values in the data
(binary data). The scatterplot colored by the numeric variable has a
continuous color scale but because all the values for this variable are
either 0 or 1, there are only two colors on the scatterplot (1 = light
blue, 0 = dark blue). If the numeric variable was truly numeric (not
based on the logical variable with only 2 values) the color of the dots
would create a gradient instead.
